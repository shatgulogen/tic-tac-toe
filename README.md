#1. Create index.html for main contents:
##1.Include score board for x and o.
##2.Include time limit input box.
##3.Include web audio and API sounds 'when time allows'.
##4.Include winning message for players.

#2. Add style to the contents
##Start with removing the border of the main grid component to set up the tic-tac board

#3. Make the logic to let the game become responsive by adding Javascript main.js
##1.set up 2 buttons for player1 and player 2 and add event listeners to player x and player o buttons on click.
##2.x starts or o starts first? Set up a button which will shuffle x and o when it is clicked and returns either x or o when clicked the second time to determine who starts the game.
##3.If an x or o has already been clicked, the same box should not respond to or update when another click at the same position occurs.
##4. Set a final score 'keep track of it' for one of the players to win the game.
##5.Display a winning message when a player wins the game and also display restart button at the same time.
##6. When the restart button is clicked, the shuffling begins to determine who gets to start the game.
